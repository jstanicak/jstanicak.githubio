  <h1>Instructions</h1>
<div style="padding=40px;">
<p>In this test, youâ€™ll be asked to help us find out easy or difficult it is to find specific information within the Intranet menu.</p>
<p>Here's how it works:</p>
<ol>
  <li>You will be asked to find a certain item on our intranet site.</li>
  <li>To get started, select the "Start task" button. You'll be presented with a list of links.</li>
  <li>Click through the list until you arrive at the list item that you think helps you complete the task. </li>
  <li>Select "I'd find it here," to move on to the next task</li>
</ol>
<p>This isn't a test of your ability, there are no right or wrong answers.</p>
